Gate bounce:
 - I'm seeing this effect where, I charge up the inductor via VSolar (off of power supply for now)
 - There is definitely current in the inductor, because then I briefly enable VBatt + GND on the other side, and then turn those gates off again
 - and I see the spike in voltage where the inductor goes just above VBATT charging it
 - but then, the inductor current shrinks, and there is a big osilation.
 - And you see the high side gates of the mosfets take on the same oscillating waveform
