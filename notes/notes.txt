Version 1.3 stuff:
 - The 10M pullup calculation was clearly wrong, voltage only gets up to around 1.25V out of 2.5, so not above the .7 Vdd it should be to be reliable.
   Do I even need the pullup, what's the leakage on the internal one? Better do some real measurements and find out
 - I should have specced 0.5% resistors on the VBATT stuff, or something more precise there in general...


Gate bounce:
 - I'm seeing this effect where, I charge up the inductor via VSolar (off of power supply for now)
 - There is definitely current in the inductor, because then I briefly enable VBatt + GND on the other side, and then turn those gates off again
 - and I see the spike in voltage where the inductor goes just above VBATT charging it
 - but then, the inductor current shrinks, and there is a big osilation.
 - And you see the high side gates of the mosfets take on the same oscillating waveform
